* Overview

This package provides an =orderless= completion style that divides
the pattern into space-separated chunks, treats each on as a
regexp, and matches canidates that match all of the regexps in any
order.

Completion styles are used as entries in the variables
=completion-styles= and =completion-category-overrides=, see their
documentation.

So to test this completion method you can put =orderless.el= somewhere
on your =load-path=, and use the following configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'orderless)
(setq completion-styles '(orderless))
#+end_src

Bug reports are highly welcome and appreciated!
